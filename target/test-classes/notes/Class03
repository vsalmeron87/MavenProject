Hooks VS Background

HOOKS ARE implemented for all the features across your project and they are based on annotations @Before and @After

Backgrounds is implemented for the specific feature. It is used to define a step or series
of steps which are common to all the test inside your feature file.


Data driven Test in Cucumber can be performed in 2 ways:
Scenario Outline with Examples
Datatable-will run your single step multiple times/headers
scenario outline- run the whole scenario multiple times


Scenario vs Scenario Outline:
Scenario will run the steps only once and finish the execution

Scenario outline will run all the steps same number of times depending on how many
sets of data you have stored inside Examples. Examples is a must for scenario outline
